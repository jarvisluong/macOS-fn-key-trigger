Fellow Mac Gamers!!!

We must all experience the problem when play games in mac we want to put the F1,F2,... keys to be its own function to play the game (i.e Dota 2 I need the F1 and F2 for the hero and courier,...). 

However, macOS is not born just for gaming, the function keys are so useful in controlling the volumne, brightness, etc...

You must feel annoying to go to the Settings and change the functions of F1, F2 back to normal, right???

Now this small script will do it automatically for you. When you play games, open it and open it again after playing. So easy, the script runs smoothly in the background and it displays a notification for you.

Say goodbye to old days going to System Settings manually... lol 

This small script will toggle the "Use F1, F2, etc as standard function key" in the System Preference of macOS. This script was written in macOS Sierra 10.12.2, thus, will be expected to work in macOS 10.12 and above.

Language: AppleScript 2.5
